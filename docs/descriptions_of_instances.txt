For testing purposes, our team used three different sets or instances
of attributes, constraints, and preferences. All files used for testing are
in the files directory.


The main test instance used for submission is in the files ending with _test.txt
attributes_test.txt, hard_constraints_test.txt, and preferences_test.txt

Test Attributes:
The attributes represent possible choices a person might have to make when
looking for a vehicle to purchase, rent, etc. These attributes are based on some
binary comparisons a person might make, like gas vs electric, or similar.

- Doors represents a choice over vehicles two or four doors.
- Engine represents a choice over the type of engine either gas or electric
- Drive represents a choice over the amount of driving wheel, all wheels or two
- Interior represents a choice over the type of interior leather or cloth
- Transmission represents a choice over the type of transmission manual or auto
- Top-style represents a choice over roof material of a vehicle hard or soft
- Type represents a choice over the type of vehicle truck or car
- Stereo represents a choice over the type of stereo xm or fm/am

Test Hard Constraints:
The hard constraints represent a personâ€™s fixed requirements beyond other
optional preferences they might have when deciding on a vehicle. These would be
non-negotiable and apply to all preferences. Some combinations of attributes
cannot be combined, and the hard constraints prevent such combinations
for things that are not possible like a manual transmission in an electric
vehicle. If a vehicle does not meet the requirements of the hard constraints,
it is not considered.

- Not electric or not manual means only gas vehicles can have a manual
  transmission and an electric vehicle can only have an automatic transmission
- Not soft or not truck means trucks are not available with soft tops only cars
- Not two or not truck means only two door trucks are considered not four doors
  trucks, even though they do make four door trucks
- Not manual or not xm is a made-up constraint that only manual vehicles can
  have a fm/am radio and cannot have an xm radio
- Not electric or not cloth is another made up constraint that electric
  vehicles are only offered with leather interior not cloth
- Not truck or not electric is another made up constraint that trucks
  cannot be electric, or if electric, only cars are considered

Test Preferences:
The preferences for penalty, possibilistic, and qualitative represent things
a person might prefer in their choice of vehicles. These are choices that
might make one vehicle more attractive than another, or another less
desirable based on various amenities or features of each vehicle.

Penalty:
- Assign a penalty to four door cars
- Assign a penalty to vehicles with leather interior and xm radios
- Assign a penalty to manual transmission or trucks
- Assign a penalty to two door or two-wheel drive vehicles
- Assign a penalty to manual transmission with soft tops
- Assign a penalty to cars with automatic transmissions

Possibilistic:
- Assign a tolerance to four door cars
- Assign a tolerance to vehicles with leather interior and xm radios
- Assign a tolerance to manual transmission or trucks
- Assign a tolerance to two door or two-wheel drive vehicles
- Assign a tolerance to manual transmission with soft tops
- Assign a tolerance to cars with automatic transmissions

Qualitative:
- Electric vehicles are better than gas vehicles if the vehicle is a car
- Four door vehicles are better than two door vehicles if the vehicle is a car
- Manual transmission or trucks are better than cars with manual transmission
- fm/am radios are better than xm radios if the vehicle is a truck
- xm is better than fm/am if the vehicle is a car
- All wheel drive is better than two-wheel drive if the vehicle is a truck


The other two sets of test cases were based on the attributes, constraints,
and preferences in the project description, and from homework one. Those
were all based on meal selection and have slight variances in attributes,
constraints, and preferences. Those were used for validation of results, as
we were able to compare the results using our homework against the
attributes, constraints, and preferences in the files ending with _hw.txt.
The other set of files ending in 1.txt were from the project description.
